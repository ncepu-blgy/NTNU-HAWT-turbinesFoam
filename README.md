# NTNU-HAWT-turbinesFoam

Case files for simulating the NTNU horizontal axis wind turbine(s) with the
[turbinesFoam](https://github.com/turbinesFoam/turbinesFoam)
actuator line model.

The purpose of this simulation is to test the ability to predict:

1. Performance and near-wake of a standalone turbine as measured in Krogstad and Adaramola (2012) "Performance and near wake measurements of a model horizontal axis wind turbine".
2. Performance curves of two in-line turbines as described in Pierella et al. (2014) "Blind Test 2 calculations for two in-line model wind turbines where the downstream turbine operates at various rotational speeds".
3. Wake profiles behind the downwind turbine (in fig. 6) for the case above.
4. Tasks 2 and 3 for the offset turbines described in Krogstad et al. (2015) "' Blind Test 3' calculations of the performance and wake development behind two in-line and offset model wind turbines".
